This is a private forum app that allows users to sign up and create posts within the database using PostGRESQL

Only authorized users are able to see authors of user posts. Otherwise, guest users can only see the content of posts but not who authored them.

This is done to spec according to the Ruby on Rails path on The Odin Project: 
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails

To run this application, you can find it deployed on Heroku here: https://shrouded-crag-98654.herokuapp.com/
